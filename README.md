<a href="https://feeds.megaphone.fm/revisionisthistory">Revisionist History</a> is <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/about/">Malcolm Gladwell</a>'s journey through the overlooked and the misunderstood. Every episode re-examines something from the past—an event, a person, an idea, even a song—and asks whether we got it right the first time. From Pushkin Industries. Because sometimes the past deserves a second chance.<br>
